It's hard to imagine life today without the **Internet**.
It is part of our daily life and makes us to be always connected and available on our phones and apps, from the time we wake up to the time that we go to bed.
But have you ever asked yourself **what is** the Internet?
In this post I'll talk about the technology and some interesting details that connects us and completely changed the way we live our lives and interact.


**Part 1: what is the Internet**

The technical definition says that the Internet is **a global system of interconnected computer networks that communicate using a set of predefined protocols**.
In other words, it is a very large scale network that connects computers all around the world and has a specific set of rules that allow new devices to communicate with the existing infrastructure.

To breakdown this idea, let's first look at what is a computer network.
Computer in this definition refers to a loose set of devices that can run programs and send and receive digital messages. It's not only the desktop or laptop computer that comes to mind, which has a monitor, a keyboard, or other input/output peripherals. For example, our smartphones are definetly computers and can communicate to other devices in many ways, icluding the cellular network, the wi-fi, Bluetooth, the usb cable, etc.
When we have two or more of these devices connected by any thechnology we have a computer network.

It is said to be global because the Internet today connects devices all over the world. The infrastructure to achieve this large scale is very diverse. We use many technologies to connect computers, and each of them has a limit of how many simultaneous devices can be connected and communicating.
The network of networks concept starts here. The global scalability of the Internet comes from this idea of connecting various smaller networks to create a global system with a much higher ceiling for the number of devices.
It is achieved by a set of predefined protocols, most notably the IP and TCP protocols, which allows messages to be sent out and arrive at the intended destination in a uncentralized set of communcation links.


**Part 2: the TCP/IP protocols**

The digital computer as we know is a relatively recent technology, which emerged from the work of many reserachers and engineers. The first electronic digital computer - ENIAC - was built in 40's. Initially, the challenge of building a single machine was large enough. But soon the need to exchange messages between those machines in order to perform more complex tasks inspired the development of computer networks.

One of the [...]


**Conclusion**

Coming down to the technical details, what we call the Internet is in fact a set of communication protocols that allows digital computers to communicate with each other in a very scalable way.

However, the term has a much larger meaning. It is a social space and connects people in ways that were unimaginable not too long ago. Together with many other technology improvements it changed the life as we know and has became central to the human experience.

But it is a topic for another day and post...
