Hi y'all, my name is **Vini** (as in Vinny, but in Portuguese) and I’m an engineer from **Brazil**. 
I graduated with a BS in Electrical Engineering in 2015, and right now I’m a PhD student at Rice University, living in Houston/TX.

My main interests are **computer networks** and **wireless communication**, and how these technologies affect the **experience of users** on the Internet. For example, what is the difference between playing an online game over a wired versus a wireless local network and what are the factors that mostly affect the performance of each system. Ultimately, I would like to learn all the little details of this **very complex system** and help shape the future communication technologies with the goal to make them better for the user, both in terms of **performance** as well **economically viability**.

In this blog I’d like to share my little knowledge as I evolve in this field of computer networks and wireless, as well as my experience as an electrical engineer in this world of computers and software development.

I’m also a strong believer in the power of **education** and how much it can transform people, and consequently our society as we know today. So I’ll try to share my histories and hopefully inspire other people to believe the same.

You can expect to read posts here on the topics of:

- Computer Networks
- Wi-Fi and Cellular communication technologies
- Research and engineering at graduate school level
- Education in Brazil and the US
- Web Development
- Traveling
- Gaming
- Life style
- Dogs :)
- And more, as inspirations come

Stay tuned and keep in touch if anything interests you!
