Hi y'all, 

This week I feel that I stepped up my knowledge big time.
During this winter break I've been working on my web dev skills and building some projects to exercise it.
My primary reference to learn are tutorials that teach something similar to what I want to build so I can modify it accordingly.
But I always feel that most online tutorials - on youtube, blogs, or free courses - are shallow when it comes to the fundamentals.
Even more, sometimes I question if the code and techniques presented are really the best way to implement such features are what are the tradeoffs involved.
I guess I got to a level where I want to see cleaner code and implementation that scales, and not only code that accomplish something simple by itself.

For my joy I found the Microsoft Docs portal and its [Learn](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/) section.
It's a free online learning platform that offers short modules and learning paths on concepts related to web develpment.
I ended up there after exploring a bit of AWS's own training section, but I have to say that Microsoft has a much more begginers friendly platform and content.
So far I completed two learning paths and I'm extremely happy with the results.

First I took the **Build JavaScript applications with Node.js** path of modules.
It teaches the basics of Node.js and walks you through the process of installing Node and creating a few projects.
Some of the projects that it covers include files and diretories manipulation and web APIs with Node and Express.
All these concepts were realtively new to me, so I was happy to follow and learn.
But more importantly, the modules go beyond the basic implementation of features and discuss the reasons why each choice was made and what are the implications.
The modules are very hands-on as well, and the projects are quite interesting and well thought.

After the first good impression I decided to search their database for more courses that I want to take.
I found a bunch of interesting topics and bookmarked a few to complete as I have time.
One that I decided to cover right away was the **Introduction to version control with Git**.
It was a different experience than the Node learning path, because I've been learning and using Git and GitHub for many years now.
But I wanted to compare MS's content to the previous resources that I had seen in the past, and I expected to see the fundamentals of Git presented much more soundly this time.
And I was **not** disappointed!
Even with a fairly extensive experience with Git for version control and colaboration I still gained a lot of knowledge.
For example, I cleaned up a lot of my version control process and learned a nice and clean way to write commit comments.
It consists in completing the phrase "When pushed, this commit will ...", for all commits in the project.
I also learned how Git works in a deeper level and picked up faster ways to go back and forth on the project history.

To sum up, I'm very happy with this finding and I plan to spend a lot more of my free time exploring the courses at Microsoft Learn.
It's still limited in content, and focus a lot on Azure tools and cloud computing concepts - which luckly interest me a lot as well -, but so far it has presented the best quality content among all learning sources that I could find.
If you are a newbie like me, or even a more experienced developer looking to sharpen your skills, I strongly suggest checking out their [page](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/).
