Hi y'all, **Merry Christmas!**

This winter break I took on the challenge of building my own personal website from scratch.
I’ve been planning to create one since I started my PhD in 2016, and this year I finally decided to take the time and do it.
My idea is to learn more about the current technologies for web development while I code something useful, so I decided to do it as a Single-Page Application (SPA) in React.

While looking through old files - to grab some content and images for the page - I came across a backup of my high school computer from over 10 years ago.
One of the folders – ok, I was a bit disorganized, so a couple of folders – had my first web pages written with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
Back then, a friend from school had introduced me into the concepts of web-design and lent me a book on CSS and JS.
Our plan was to start our own design company and dominate the world – both which we clearly haven’t accomplished yet.
In fact, I haven’t done any more web development since ‘09, and I haven’t kept up with the new techniques in the field either.

And that’s when the tale of the two pages occurred to me today.
By comparing my first website from more than 10 years ago with my latest work on my personal page I realized how far we have came with the way we design and build websites.
I confess, it may reflect a lot more on my own progress than the community in general, but it is still clear how much better we got technology-wise.
For example, one of the features that I experimented with was an animated circular menu (???), which brings the clicked item to the top by rotating the entire structure of menu items.
Note that the dominant technology for elaborate animations at the time was the Adobe Flash (R.I.P. 2020), and I created this menu using plain CSS and JS – I would move positions around based on the equation of the circle and add a timeout between steps to create the movement effect.
Today it would be super trivial to do the same using an open-source animation library.
Another big issue at the time was browser compatibility.
I’m aware it is still a problem, but we’ve definitely came a **looong** way on that one.

My personal website is coming through just fine. I’m learning a lot about the React basics and practicing several techniques.
The source code is available at [my Github repo](https://github.com/ViniBR01/personal-site).
Feel free to check it out and use any part of it as you'd like.
Be aware that it is not optimized in any way, not in performance, not in structure or consistency.
The goal of this project is to learn and explore, so it mixes many techniques to so the same things in completely different ways.
