This is a basic blog built with React from scratch.
It uses the Next.js framework, which easily abstracts optimazations such as code spliting, server-side pre-rendering, client-side routing, and much more.


This application is built from the tutorial at [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/create-nextjs-app).
